    <p>
        I am a visiting scholar in the Department of Psychology at Arizona State University.
        I am conducting a research study to understand how people make decisions in groups.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am inviting your participation, which will involve playing a live group game with another real player.
        You will first provide some basic demographic information. You will then read some instructions about
        the live group game. Before beginning the game, you will play an example round with the computer and
        answer some comprehension questions to make sure you understand the game. The game itself will require
        you to manage a resource over time. The study should take no longer than one hour, and you have the
        right not to answer any question, and to stop participation at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your participation in this study is voluntary. If you choose not to participate or to withdraw from the
        study at any time, there will be no penalty. You must be 18 or older to participate in this study.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are no foreseeable risks or discomforts to your participation. You will be compensated for your time
        by receiving one research participation credit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your responses will be anonymous. The results of this study may be used in reports, presentations, or
        publications but your name will never be used.
